    <h1 class="page-title">About Spectra</h1>
    <p><strong>Spectra</strong> was created with one mission in mind: to make emotional support and self-care tools accessible to everyone, every day. In a world where mental health often takes a backseat, Spectra offers a gentle space to pause, breathe, and reconnect with yourself.</p>

    <p>Backed by psychology-informed design and powered by artificial intelligence, Spectra guides you through mindful conversations, breathing exercises, and gratitude journaling. It’s not therapy—but it is thoughtful, compassionate, and always available when you need to reset or reflect.</p>

    <p>From anxiety to burnout, from moments of stress to the desire to build healthier emotional habits, Spectra is here to accompany you in small, supportive ways that make a big difference over time.</p>
